Design Rationale:
- Actors who repair Droids become the Droids Owners.
- Only Tuscan Raiders and Player, Luke can heal Droids.
- Droids inherit the team of the owner.
- Droid's mobiltiy will be a method in the actor class that relies on its HitPoints in order to move.

- Player Actor can only train when adjacent to actor Ben.
- When a Tuscan Raider is adjacent to Ben, Ben will have a 50/50 chance of using force or striking them.
- If a Droid is adjacent to Ben, they will be struck.
- 2 deactivated droids will spawn on load of the map.
- Canteens can be destroyed when canteen HP goes down to 0.
- Light Sabre's are wieldable if high enough force, has force affordance.

- Only Ben and Luke can use the Force.
- When Ben uses the force on Tuscan Raiders, it has a 75% chance of succeeding.
- The direction Ben attempts to convince the Raiders into moving is towards the centre of the Badlands.
- When Luke uses the force on Tuscan Raiders, it has a 50% chance of succeeding unless he has been trained
by Ben then it is also a 75% chance of working.
- When Luke uses the force, he is prompted to enter the direction he wishes the Tuscan Raider to move.
